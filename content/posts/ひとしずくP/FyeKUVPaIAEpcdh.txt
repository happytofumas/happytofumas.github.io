rumors against LGBT parties
(especially transgender women),
who are not related to sex offenders
at all and live peacefully, will become
stronger. There is a concern that the
law, which was originally intended to
deepen the understanding of LGBT
parties, will, on the contrary, damage
the image and position of LGBT
parties through reputational
damage.

Against this background, we have
indicated our opposition to the bill.
We are concerned about this bill,
which is full of holes that only benefit
reserve sex offenders, instead of
being respectful to LGBT parties,
women, children, and all people of
good will.
